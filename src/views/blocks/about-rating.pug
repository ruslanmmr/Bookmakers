    h4.title.title_style1 Important Deciding Factors for Bookmaker's Rank in The List
    h5.title.title_style2 Betting odds
    p This is a crucial factor when it comes to the comparison of bookmakers. High and attractive odds translate to huge winnings. As such, the higher the odds of a sportsbook, the higher the number of punters that will sign-up with it. This means that it will rank higher as compared to those that offer lower odds.
    h5.title.title_style2 Broad betting range
    p Even when a large number of punters frequently bet on football, there is still the need for a bookmaker to have a broader range of betting selections. It serves no interest for a sportsbook to only offer betting for the 1st premier league when the best odds to bet on are those on Champions League matches. The more extensive a bookmaker is the higher will be its ranking.
    h5.title.title_style2 Bet limit amount
    p When it comes to betting, punters don't like it when they are restricted on the upper limit of a bet, especially when there is a potential to win big. However, this is what some reputable sportsbooks offer. They do this by setting an upper and a lower betting limit amount.
    h5.title.title_style2 Convenient deposit and withdrawal methods
    p Reputable online bookmakers provide all available options of depositing or withdrawing cash to allow gamblers to make deposits conveniently. For instance, some offer instant credit card transfer or used payment options such as Giropay, Click2Pay, or Paysafecard.
    h5.title.title_style2 High welcome bonus
    p A wagering welcome bonus allows a new punter to quickly get familiar with the interesting sports betting arena. Experienced gamblers with over ten recommended top providers can gladly take an extra bonus code for either new or existing clients and then utilize them as extra capital on their wagering plans.
